# Support Ticket Performance & Issue Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer support ticket data to identify high-volume issues, resolution inefficiencies, and drivers of customer dissatisfaction. The dashboard is designed to support operational decision-making and customer experience improvement.

## Business Questions
- Which issue categories generate the highest support volume?
- Which issues take the longest to resolve?
- How do reopen rates and resolution time impact customer satisfaction?
- Are certain issues more prominent for specific products or customer types?
- Where should support teams prioritize improvement efforts?

## Tools Used
- Excel — data validation, exploratory analysis, pivot tables
- Power BI — KPI development, interactive dashboards, issue-level analysis

## Key Metrics (KPIs)
- Total Tickets
- Average Resolution Time (Hours)
- Average CSAT Score
- Reopen Rate (%)

## Key Insights (Summary)
- Document Upload and Sync Issues account for the highest ticket volume, indicating workflow friction.
- UI Confusion and Performance issues show higher reopen rates, suggesting quality and stability challenges.
- Calculation Errors have longer resolution times, reflecting higher technical complexity.
- Reopened tickets are associated with lower CSAT scores, highlighting the importance of first-contact resolution.

## Recommendations
- Improve Document Upload workflows to reduce recurring ticket volume.
- Develop escalation playbooks for complex Calculation Errors to shorten resolution time.
- Flag reopened tickets for senior-agent review to improve resolution quality and CSAT.
- Prioritize performance-related issues with high reopen rates.
